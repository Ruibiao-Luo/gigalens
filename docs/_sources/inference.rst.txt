Probabilistic Inference Pipeline
====================================
In its current implementation, there are four major steps in doing inference on
an observed lensing system.

Model Specification
------------------------------------

The first is always necessary: model specification.

MAP, SVI, and HMC
------------------------------------
Given an observed system, the goal is to draw samples from the posterior distribution.
