Probabilistic Inference Pipeline
====================================
In its current implementation, there are four major steps in doing inference on
an observed lensing system.

Model Specification
------------------------------------

The first is always necessary: model specification. Of course, we cannot begin to
do inference on our data without writing out, explicitly, a model that 'tells us
how the data was generated'. For gravitational lenses, this is comprised of:

    a. A parameterized physical model for the lensing system. This is a model for the mass profile of the main lens,
       potentially a model the effects of any nearby interlopers, and a model for the light of both
       the lens and source.

    b. A probabilistic model, that consists of a prior for the physical parameters, as well as
       a likelihood function. Defining a likelihood requires a noise model, which for most purposes
       will consist of modeling the noise on a given pixel as the independent sum of background Gaussian
       noise :math:`\sigma_{bkg}` (conventionally written as ``background_rms``) and Poisson shot noise
       with exposure time :math:`t_{exp}` (conventionally written as ``exp_time``).

Although these two components of the model are not completely separate (since the prior in the
probabilistic model is for parameters defined by the physical model), they are mostly decoupled.
Therefore, in our implementation, we are careful to keep these two components of the model distinct.
The following are our package's high level descriptions for a physical and probabilistic model.

MAP, SVI, and HMC
------------------------------------
Given an observed system, the goal is to draw samples from the posterior distribution.
